# The Command Line
The command line is an interesting beast, and if you've not used one before, can be a bit daunting.e 
you can leave the GUI alltogether, most people open up a command line interface just as another window 
on their desktop (in fact you can have as many open as you like)


***So what are they exactly?***

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. 
You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

***Opening a Terminal***

Opening a terminal is fairly easy. I can't tell you exactly how to do it as every system is different
but here are a few places to start looking.

-If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
-If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
-If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) .
