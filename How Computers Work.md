# How Computers Work ..!


A computer is an electronic machine that processes informationâ€”in other words, an information processor: 
it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a
bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in 
information is called input, storing information is better known as memory (or storage), 
chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.

**How They Work Together**

First, you provide input when you turn on the computer. Then the system software tells the CPU to start
up certain programs and to turn on some hardware devices so that they are ready for
more input from you. This whole process is called booting up.
