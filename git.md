# Git..

**Git** is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your
project **called commit** Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. 
Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources.
the Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.
