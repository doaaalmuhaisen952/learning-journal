# Learning Markdown

*Welcome to growth middset Pages

**first the Markdown is a way to write content for the web. It’s written in what people like to call “plaintext”,and
Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can optionally be converted to HTML.**

**What’s Markdown Good For?**
Markdown is a fast and easy way to take notes, create content for a website, and produce print-ready documents.



To summarize, this is a four-part process:

1. Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an .md or .markdown extension.
2. Open the Markdown file in a Markdown application.
3. Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.
4. View the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown application to convert it to another file format, like PDF.
